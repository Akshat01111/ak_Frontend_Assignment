Q-4. What are HTML Entities? With Example

* HTML Entities

=> The HTML entities are used to display reserved characters , special characters, or invisible characters. 

HTML character entities are used as a replacement of reserved characters in HTML. You can also replace characters that are not present on your keyboard by entities.

These characters are replaced because some characters are reserved in HTML. HTML entities provide a wide range of characters which can allow you to add icons, geometric shapes, mathematical operators, etc.

For example: if you use less than (<) or greater than (>) symbols in your text, the browser can mix them with tags that's why character entities are used in HTML to display reserved characters.


** Non-breaking Space 

A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;

A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.

Example: 

<h1>HTML Entity Example</h1>

<h2>A space character:&nbsp;The paragraph&nbsp;demo module that comes inside the 8.x-1.0 has some&nbsp;dependencies that might need review.</h2>
