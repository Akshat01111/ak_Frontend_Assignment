Q-2.  What are tags and attributes in HTML?

* What Are HTML Tags?


 ==>> HTML tags are what defines where an HTML element starts and where it ends. There is usually an opening bracket followed by the elementâ€™s name and, finally, a closing bracket.

In most cases, there is always a start tag and an end tag enclosing an element. Nevertheless, that is not the case for all elements.

As far as HTML is concerned, there are several types of a tag. The first one is the start tag. It contains two opposite angle brackets. Examples include:

<title>
<p>
<b>
The other one is the end tag. The similarity to the start tag, it has angle brackets. However, there is a forward slash after the first angle bracket. Examples of the end tags corresponding to the start tags above are as follows.

</title>
</p>
</b>


* What are HTML Attributes?


 ==>> HTML attributes specify various additional properties to the existing HTML element.

  Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.

An example of an attribute is:

<img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog.">
In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the <img> tag.
