Q-7. What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
elements? With Example.


* What is ID in HTML?

            In HTML, the "id" selector is used id attribute of an element. For an HTML element, the "id" name starts with the symbol '#' followed by a unique name. One important characteristics of the id element is that we can only attach one id selector to an element. Hence, the ID selector is always unique within an HTML page.

=> Example:

<style>
  #idDemo
  {
     color:red;
     font-size:25px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body style="text-align:center">
   <h1>Get element by Id</h1>
   <p id="idDemo">Demo for Id </p>
</body>


* What is CLASS in HTML?

                In HTML, the "class" selector is used to select an element with a specific class attribute. The class selector starts with a period (.) followed by a class name. Unlike the id selector, we can attach multiple selector to an HTML element.


=> Example:

<style>
   .classDemo
   {
       color:yellow;
       font-size:25px;
   }
</style>
</head>
<body style="text-align:center">
	<h1>Get element by class<h1>
	<p class="classDemo">Demo for class </p>
</body>
