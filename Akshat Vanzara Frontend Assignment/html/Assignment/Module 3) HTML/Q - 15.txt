Q-15. How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? With Example.


* We can also use CSS to set any image as the background of the webpage. To do so, we will need to specify the desired imageâ€™s location or URL to the background-image property.


=> Example:

    <style>
        body
        {
            background: url(images/istockphoto-517188688-170667a.jpg) no-repeat;
            background-size: cover;
            background-attachment: fixed;
        }    
    </style>
