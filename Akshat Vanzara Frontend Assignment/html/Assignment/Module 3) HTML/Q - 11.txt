Q-11. What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

* Block elements: 
                  They consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency. They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins. It does not contain any other elements next to it.

-> Examples of Block elements:

<h1>-<h6> : This element is used for including headings of different sizes ranging from 1 to 6.
<div>: This is a container tag and is used to make separate divisions of content on the web page.
<hr>: This is an empty tag and is used for separating content by horizontal lines.
<li>: This tag is used for including list items of an ordered or unordered list.
<ul>: This tag is used to make an unordered list.
<ol>: This tag is used to make an ordered list.
<p>: This tag is used to include paragraphs of content in the webpage.
<table>: This tag is used for including the tables in the webpage when there is a need for tabular data.


* Inline elements:
                 Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline. Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and bottom margins as block elements have.

-> Examples of Inline elements:

<a>: This tag is used for including hyperlinks in the webpage.
<br>: This tag is used for mentioning line breaks in the webpage wherever needed.
<input>: This tag is used for taking input from the users and is mainly used in forms.
<img>: This tag is used for including different images in the webpage to add beauty to the webpage.
<span>:  This is an inline container that takes necessary space only.
<b>:  This tag is used in places where bold text is needed.
