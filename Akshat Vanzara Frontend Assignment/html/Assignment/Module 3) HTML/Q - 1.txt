Q-1.  Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?


  * HTML Tags: The starting and ending point parts of an HTML document are HTML Tags, which start with < (less than) and end with >(greater than) angle bracket, and whatever is written inside the angle brackets are known as tags.

    Both opening and closing tags must be there in order to function. There are also some self enclosing tags which require only one tag such as <hr>, <img>, <br> etc. The ending slash over here is optional.

    => Example: This example shows how a paragraph tag is used (consist of both start and end) and <hr> tag (self-closing tag).

    <!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset='utf-8'>
        <meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>
        <title>Page Title</title>
        <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1'>
        <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' media='screen' href='main.css'>
        <script src='main.js'></script>
    </head>
<body>
	
		<h2>Example</h2>
        <hr>
		<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Placeat, consequuntur. Quam quisquam autem odit iure exercitationem quaerat sint voluptatem animi non suscipit commodi, dolore, velit vel perferendis corrupti ea dignissimos.<hr> Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nulla eveniet sit quo perferendis, iste distinctio nostrum unde quos repudiandae commodi voluptate facilis ad assumenda recusandae officiis quae a alias reprehenderit?</p>
	
</body>

</html> -->

* HTML Element 

 An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. It represents semantics, or meaning. 

Most HTML elements are written with a start tag (or opening tag) and an end tag (or closing tag), with content in between.

* For example, the title element represents the title of the document.
