Q-1. What are the benefits of using CSS?

Ans:-
     
    1) Faster Page Speed:-

        More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.

    2) Better User Experience:-

        CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves.

    3) Quicker Development Time:-

        With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance, you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of that same type.

    4) Easy Formatting Changes:-

        If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet.

    5) Compatibility Across Devices:-

        Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all devices. Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines with HTML to make responsive design possible.

    6) Global Styling:-

        External CSS files can be linked to multiple web pages, making it easy to apply consistent styling across an entire website. This saves time and ensures a cohesive design.

    7) Efficient Updates:-

        When you need to update the styling of a website, you can make changes in one central CSS file. This means that updates are applied universally, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
