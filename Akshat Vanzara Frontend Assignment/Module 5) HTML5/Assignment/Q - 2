    -> As not all browsers support all audio formats, the audio file is encoded/decoded with an audio codec (a digital electronic device or computer-based software application that aids in the compression and decompression of a digital audio data). All formats of audio files are added simultaneously via the <source> element with the src attribute.

    <body>
        <audio controls>
          <source src="/build/audios/jingle_bells.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
          <source src="/build/audios/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
